# {{ codebase_name }}

This is the project memory file for Claude Code. It provides persistent context
about the codebase structure, conventions, and active work items so you do not
need to re-explain the project at the start of each session.

## Project Overview

- **Codebase:** `{{ codebase_name }}`
- **Root:** `{{ codebase_path }}`
- **Active tasks:** {{ active_task_count }}

{% include "shared/_stack.tera" %}

## Conventions

- Follow existing code style — match indentation, naming, and module structure.
- Never introduce new dependencies without confirming necessity.
- Keep changes minimal and focused; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Run the project's test suite before marking a task complete.
- Prefer small, reviewable commits over large sweeping changes.

## Development Commands

Refer to the README or project root for build, test, and lint commands.
Ask for clarification if you are unsure which commands apply.

## Notes

- Registry YAML is the source of truth; rendered agent files are outputs.
- Use `orchestra sync {{ codebase_name }}` to regenerate this file after registry changes.
