## Project

- **Name:** `{{ codebase_name }}`
- **Root:** `{{ codebase_path }}`
- **Active tasks:** {{ active_task_count }}

## Stack
{% for project in projects %}
- `{{ project.name }}` — `{{ project.project_type }}`
{% endfor %}

## Architecture

Refer to the project README and inline documentation for architecture details.
When in doubt about where code belongs, ask rather than guessing.

## Rules

- **Style:** Match existing conventions in each file. Do not reformat unrelated code.
- **Dependencies:** Do not add new libraries without explicit approval.
- **Scope:** Keep changes minimal and targeted; avoid unrelated modifications.
- **Tests:** All new code must have corresponding tests. Run the full test suite before marking a task done.
- **Commits:** Write clear commit messages describing *what* changed and *why*.
- **PRs:** Keep pull requests small and focused on a single concern.
- **Security:** Never commit secrets, credentials, or API keys.
