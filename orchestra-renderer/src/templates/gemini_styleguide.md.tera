# Style Guide — `{{ codebase_name }}`

This file defines code-review standards and style conventions for Gemini Code Assist.

## General

- Match the style of adjacent files in every edit.
- Preserve existing indentation — do not reformat beyond the changed lines.
- Keep line length consistent with the rest of the file.

## Naming

- Use descriptive names — avoid single-letter variables outside short loop indices.
- Follow the naming convention of the language in use (snake_case, camelCase, PascalCase, etc.).

## Documentation

- All public functions and types must have documentation comments.
- Comments should explain *why*, not *what* — the code shows what.

## Testing

- Every new business-logic function requires at least one unit test.
- Test edge cases: empty inputs, boundary values, and error paths.

## Security

- Never commit secrets, credentials, or API keys.
- Validate all inputs on the server side.
- Use parameterized queries — never string-interpolate user input into SQL.
