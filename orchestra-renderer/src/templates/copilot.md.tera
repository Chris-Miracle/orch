# Copilot Instructions — `{{ codebase_name }}`

## Project Overview

This repository is **`{{ codebase_name }}`** located at `{{ codebase_path }}`.
{% if projects %}The codebase contains the following projects:
{% for project in projects %}
- **{{ project.name }}** (`{{ project.project_type }}`)
{% endfor %}{% endif %}

## What to Generate

- Follow the existing file structure and naming conventions already in the codebase.
- Match the language and framework idioms present in each directory.
- When creating new files, mirror the style of adjacent files.
- Generate complete, working implementations — avoid TODO stubs unless explicitly asked.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Do not introduce dependencies not already in the project.
- Do not reformat code outside the lines you are changing.
- Do not generate overly verbose comments — match the existing comment density.
- Do not change unrelated files when asked to modify a specific feature.

## Coding Standards

- Prefer the patterns already established in the codebase.
- Keep functions focused and small.
- All public APIs must have documentation comments.
- Tests must be written for all new business logic.

## Active Tasks ({{ active_task_count }})
{% for task in tasks %}
- **{{ task.id }}** [{{ task.status }}] — {{ task.title }}{% if task.description %}
  {{ task.description }}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}{% if not tasks %}No tasks currently registered.{% endif %}
