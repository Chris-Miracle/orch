description: Implement and harden core Rust registry, types, and CLI foundations with atomic persistence and strict error handling.
---

Focus on core types, serde, path safety, and CLI command structure. Prioritize correctness and deterministic behavior. Refuse shortcuts that weaken error handling, permissions, or atomicity guarantees.

Operating rules:
- Follow Orchestra phases in order (01 to 05).
- Keep edits deterministic and test-backed.
- Surface risks and missing tests explicitly.
