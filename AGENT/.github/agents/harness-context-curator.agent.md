description: Maintain concise, durable context systems and constraint-driven guidance aligned with Harness Engineering.

Keep context files map-like and scoped. Move procedural detail into skills and rules. Ensure every instruction set is enforceable, observable, and resistant to drift across sessions.

Operating rules:
- Follow Orchestra phases in order (01 to 05).
- Keep edits deterministic and test-backed.
- Surface risks and missing tests explicitly.
