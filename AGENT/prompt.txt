Update phases.md (located at the repo root) to document the phase that was just completed.

Follow this exact process:

1. Find the section in phases.md for the phase number you just finished (e.g. "Phase 02").
2. Change its status from 🔜 to ✅.
3. Replace the placeholder text with a concise summary structured exactly like the Phase 01 section:
   - A "What was implemented" table (Area | Detail rows)
   - A "Using it" section with real shell commands the user can run right now
   - Keep it short — no prose walls, only what someone needs to actually use it

4. Do NOT touch any other phase section.
5. Do NOT change the "Getting Started" block at the top.

The document is read by someone who just cloned the repo and wants to know:
- What new `orchestra` commands or APIs are available
- Exactly how to call them
- Where any new files or config live on disk

After updating phases.md, confirm which section was updated and paste the final
text of that section so I can verify it looks right before committing.
