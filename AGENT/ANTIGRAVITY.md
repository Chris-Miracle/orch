# Antigravity Context Pack (Manual)

This repository includes role and skill prompt packs for Antigravity in:
- `/Users/chris/Dev/OS/orch/AGENT/antigravity/agents/`
- `/Users/chris/Dev/OS/orch/AGENT/antigravity/skills/`

Use these packs to seed Antigravity agent profiles and workflows until a stable local file-spec is documented.

## Core Expectations
- Respect Orchestra phase ordering.
- Keep synchronization deterministic and observable.
- Use explicit test and risk reporting for each major change.
